# Introduction to Data Management

This file covers the basics of data, types of data, data management concepts, and an overview of the DAMA Framework, based on my study of the DAMA-DMBOK.

## What is Data?
- Data is anything you collect, store, and process in an organization.
- When processed correctly, data turns into information that helps make quick and accurate decisions.

## Types of Data
- **Structured Data**: Organized data stored in tables, like in databases or data warehouses.
- **Unstructured Data**: Unorganized data, like text, images, videos, or audio.
- **Semi-Structured Data**: Partially organized, like XML files.
- **Metadata**: Data about data, describing details like file size or creator.
- **Transactional Data**: Data from daily operations, like sales or orders.
- **Quality Data**: Data reflecting performance, like customer feedback or survey results.
- **Geographical Data**: Data related to locations.
- **Big Data**: Massive amounts of data generated quickly, like social media or IoT sensor data, requiring tools like Hadoop or Spark.

## What is Big Data?
- Refers to huge volumes of data generated at high speed, like social media posts or IoT sensor outputs.
- Needs specialized tools (e.g., Hadoop, Spark) to process and analyze.

## How Data Becomes Information
- **Data**: Raw, meaningless facts (e.g., random numbers).
- **Information**: Data with context, making it meaningful (e.g., numbers showing sales for a day).
- This process follows the **DIKW Pyramid**:
  - **Data** → **Information** → **Knowledge** → **Wisdom**.
  - Example: Raw numbers (data) → Sales totals (information) → Understanding sales trends (knowledge) → Deciding to stock more items (wisdom).

## Data Management
- **Goal**: Organize data properly to achieve **data governance** (control and standardization).
- Key components:
  - **Data Architecture**: Understand systems and how data is stored.
  - **Data Modeling**: Design data structures and relationships (e.g., tables and links).
  - **Metadata Management**: Know details about data (e.g., who the customer is, data type).
  - **Master Data**: Unified, non-duplicated data (e.g., one product name across systems).
  - **Data Quality**: Ensure data is accurate, consistent, and complete.
  - **Data Security**: Protect data with encryption and access controls.
  - **Data Warehouse**: A place to store cleaned, organized data from multiple sources.
  - **Business Intelligence**: Use data to analyze and make decisions.

## Common Data Issues
- **Inaccuracy**: Mixing up data, like swapping birth dates and order dates.
- **Inconsistency**: Same data written differently (e.g., "Main St" vs. "Main Street").
- **Missing Data**: Incomplete data, like missing customer phone numbers.
- **Outdated Data**: Old data, like a dashboard showing sales from hours ago instead of real-time.

## What is a Data Warehouse?
- A storage system (usually a database) for cleaned and organized data from various sources.
- Used for analysis and reporting.

## Data Protection
- Laws like **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation) protect personal data.
- Personal data must be secured and not shared without permission.
- **Encryption**: Uses public and private keys to secure data.

## Who Manages Data?
- Data management is a team effort, not the responsibility of one person.
- A **Data Management Office** or team works together to implement data strategies.

## Why is Data Management Important?
- Helps control data like a valuable asset.
- Ensures data is accurate for better decision-making.
- Protects data with security measures.
- Allows organizations to benefit from data (e.g., through analysis or sales).

## CDMP Certification
- **Certified Data Management Professional** from DAMA (Data Management Association).
- Proves expertise in data management.
- **Levels**: Associate, Practitioner, Master, Fellow (for those with 25+ years of experience).
- **Exam**: 100 multiple-choice questions, 60% pass rate for Associate, 70-80% for higher levels.
- Boosts career prospects and credibility in the job market.

## DAMA Framework
- A framework covering all aspects of data management (quality, security, warehouses, etc.).
- Based on the **DAMA-DMBOK** (2nd edition).
- Focuses on three pillars: **People** (team), **Processes** (steps), and **Technology**.

## Applying Data Management
- Start by understanding your systems and data.
- Create data models (e.g., tables and relationships).
- Ensure data quality and security.
- Use tools like data warehouses or CRM systems to unify data.
