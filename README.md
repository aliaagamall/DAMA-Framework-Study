# DAMA Framework Study

## Overview
This repository is my personal collection of study notes for the **DAMA Framework** and **CDMP certification** preparation. I’ll be adding notes incrementally as I study each section of the DAMA-DMBOK (Data Management Body of Knowledge). The goal is to keep everything organized, simple, and easy to review for the CDMP exam.

## Structure
- Each file in the repo represents a specific section or topic from the DAMA Framework.
- Files are written in **Markdown** for easy readability and formatting.
- I’ll update the repo regularly as I study new topics, adding new files or updating existing ones.

## Current Files
- `intro.md`: Introduction to data, types of data, data management basics, and the DAMA Framework overview.

## How to Use
- Check the files in the repo to review notes on specific topics.
- Each file covers a key concept or chapter from the DAMA-DMBOK.
- I’ll keep adding files as I progress through my studies, so the repo will grow over time.

## Contribution
This is a personal study repo, but feel free to suggest improvements or share resources if you’re also studying for the CDMP
